# rockPaperScissors
a very simple project made by javascript.
I hope you like it.
It's not perfect, there are a few problems I couldn't 
figure out I just hope to be able to solve it in the future when I learn more.
css.style file was a mistake a named it incorrectly but it's not linked to the project
so it wouldn't affect anything.
